{"text": "## Introduction\n\nToday's and tomorrow's Air Traffic Management  (ATM)  is  faced with numerous challenges:  capacity  increase,  safety  improvement, diminished  environmental  impact  and  cost  decrease [1,  2]. Many  research  and  development  (R&D) activities  are  undertaken  in  order  to  design  and develop a modern ATM system which would respond to these challenges. Various modeling and simulation tools, which range from mathematical models to fast and  real-time  simulations,  are  used  to  develop  and evaluate the new systems. Aircraft trajectory simulation and prediction is one of the key functions of  these  tools. This  function  requires  an  Aircraft Performance  Model  (APM)  to  provide  geometric, kinetic and kinematic aspects of the aircraft behaviour.\n\nDifferent  modeling  and  simulation  tools  have different requirements  towards  an  APM. These requirements may be expressed in terms of:\n\n- · accuracy of aircraft performance parameters for  specific  parts  of  the  aircraft  flight envelope,\n- · support  of  different  aircraft  operations  and flight phases,\n- · coverage of different aircraft types,\n- · levels  of  complexity  and  computational requirements.\n\nSome  applications might require accurate modeling of the aircraft path and 100 % coverage of the  aircraft  types  in  operation  today,  while  others request  accurate  modeling  of  fuel  consumption  and aircraft forces for only several aircraft types.\n\nTo address these different requirements, several aircraft performance modeling approaches, and consequently several forms of APM, exist. This paper addresses the EUROCONTROL aircraft performance model called BADA (Base of Aircraft Data) and its ability to meet these requirements.\n\nThe  paper  is  structured  into  four  sections. The first section proposes a short overview of the BADA model.", "metadata": {"source_path": "data/raw/advanced-aircraft-performance-model-for-atm-bada-2010.pdf", "doc_type": "pdf", "title": "advanced-aircraft-performance-model-for-atm-bada-2010", "page_count": 14, "topic": "## Introduction", "chunk_tokens": 395}, "token_count": 395}

{"text": "## BADA Model Overview\n\nBADA  is  based  on  a  mass-varying,  kinetic approach to  aircraft  performance  modeling  [3].

BADA Model Structure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBADA APM is structured into four sub-models: Actions, Motion, Operations and Limitations model.\n\nThe Actions model represents the forces acting on  the  aircraft  and  responsible  for  its  motion.  It  is divided into three categories -aerodynamic, gravitational  and  propulsive  -  including  four  forces acting  on  the  aircraft  (lift,  drag,  weight  and  thrust) and fuel consumption which affects the aircraft mass. Therefore, the Actions model  consists of the following sub-models: Drag, Lift, Weight, Thrust and Fuel consumption.\n\nThe Motion model  consists  of  the  system  of different equations that describes the aircraft motion.\n\nThe Operations model describes different ways of  operating  the  aircraft  that  are  not  part  of  Actions and Motion model.\n\nThe Limitations model  ensures  a  realistic aircraft behaviour within certain limits.\n\nA  generic Airline  Procedure  Model  (ARPM) is proposed in BADA: it provides nominal speeds for the  climb,  cruise  and  descent  phases,  assuming normal aircraft operations.\n\nEach  aircraft  model  in  BADA  is  characterized with a set of coefficients, called Aircraft Characteristics ,  which  is  used  by  the  APM  and ARPM.\n\nMore details on sub-models are provided in [3, 4, 5, 6].", "metadata": {"source_path": "data/raw/advanced-aircraft-performance-model-for-atm-bada-2010.pdf", "doc_type": "pdf", "title": "advanced-aircraft-performance-model-for-atm-bada-2010", "page_count": 14, "topic": "## BADA Model Overview", "chunk_tokens": 389}, "token_count": 389}

The primary objective of BADA 3 is to model aircraft behaviour over the normal operations part  of  the  flight  envelope,  while  BADA  4  aims  at providing  modeling  capabilities  for  the  complete aircraft flight envelope.\n\nKeeping this in mind, the main characteristics of the  two  model  families  are  summarized  in  this section  by  applying  a  set  of  Key  Performance Indicators 1 (KPIs) that are considered most meaningful for assessment of an APM in the context of its use in the ATM.\n\n## Capability\n\nThe  capability  of  an  APM  is  defined  by  the performance  aspects  it  is  capable  of  providing,  and how  they  are  provided.

{"text": "## I. INTRODUCTION\n\nMuch of the research being performed as part of the current Air Traffic Management (ATM) modernization effort involves trajectory optimization  [1,2]. The  purpose  of  trajectory optimization  is  to  determine  the  values  of  some  flight parameters (e.g. flight route, cruise altitude, speed profile) that minimize  (or  maximize)  one  or  several  optimization  criteria (e.g. trip cost, trip fuel, noise, emissions). The influence of such flight parameters on the optimization criteria is often determined by aircraft performances. The trajectory computation  and  simulation  tools  used  for  ATM  trajectory optimization  research  rely  on  aircraft  performance  models (APM), such as BADA 3 [3,4], BADA 4 [2,5,6,7], Piano-X [8] or  custom  models  [9]. The  validity  of  these  models  for optimization purposes, however, has often not been demonstrated. Accuracy  evaluations  have  been  performed  for some  of  these  APM,  using  either  manufacturer  performance data (e.g. flight manuals) [10] or flight data recordings [4,11] as reference. Such  evaluations  only  provide  an  estimation  of  a model's  accuracy  (e.g. fuel  flow  error)  in  given  flight conditions, which is not sufficient to infer how accurate would be  the  determination  of  optimum  flight  conditions  using  this model.

METHODOLOGY\n\nThe  cruise  speed  optimization  considered  in  this  study consists in the determination of the cruise speed that minimizes (or  maximizes)  a  specific  optimization  criterion  based  on  the fuel  consumption,  under  given  values  of  the  remaining  flight conditions (e.g. cruise altitude and aircraft weight). The results of this optimization consist of both the optimum cruise speed, and the value of the corresponding fuel consumption.\n\nIn order to evaluate the applicability of a modern APM to cruise speed optimization, this study compares:\n\n-  On the one hand, a set of reference cruise optimization results obtained from an aircraft manufacturer performance  tool,  which  can  be  considered  the  most accurate source of performance data for each individual aircraft type.\n-  On the other hand, a set of candidate cruise optimization results estimated,  in  the  same  conditions  as  the reference  data,  by  a  candidate  APM  representative  of modern  APMs  that  can  be  used  in  ATM  trajectory optimization applications.\n\nThe selected aircraft manufacturer is Boeing, who provided reference  data  for  seven  aircraft  types  that  include  twin-  and quad-engine jets, as well as narrow- and wide-body airframes, in  order  to  be  representative of  current  jet  airliner  operations.

The fuel consumption of jet engines depends on the  engines'  thrust,  which  can  be  considered  as  equal  to  the airframe drag during cruise at constant speed and altitude [22]. Since the candidate APM is based on a kinetic approach, which models  the  forces  acting  on  the  aircraft,  the  accuracy  of  the drag and fuel flow models of the candidate APM are therefore paramount  to  the  accuracy  of  the  APM  cruise  speed optimization results.\n\nFig. 11.

DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK\n\nIn  this  study,  the  reference  data  used  to  evaluate  the candidate APM  were  computed from a performance engineering  software,  considered  by  the  aircraft  manufacturer as the most accurate source of performance data. The optimum cruise  speed  actually  flown  by  an  aircraft,  however,  is determined  by  the  on-board  FMS,  and  this  FMS  may  use performance databases and optimization algorithms that differ from the manufacturer performance tools, resulting in different optimization  results.  Using  the  methodology  presented  in  this paper  with  FMS  optimization  results  as  a  reference  would therefore  provide  a  useful  complement  to  the  present  study. The  collection  of  FMS  optimization  results  for  a  variety  of aircraft  types  and  flight  conditions  may  prove  challenging however, considering the need to access real aircraft.\n\nAccording to the results presented in this paper, BADA 4 can  be  considered  as  a  suitable  APM  for  cruise  speed optimizations  in  ATM  simulations  or  environmental  impact assessments, but it may  not  yet  satisfy the accuracy requirements of other applications. The authors, who participate  to  the  development  of  BADA  4,  intend  to  use  the insight  gained from  this study to guide  the next evolutions of this  APM.

CONCLUSIONS\n\nThis  paper  has  evaluated  the  accuracy  of  trajectory optimization  results  from  a  modern  APM  designed  for  ATM applications,  using  reference  data  from  a  major  aircraft manufacturer. The study focused on cruise speed optimization and  considered  several  aircraft  types  representative  of  jet airliner operations. A detailed evaluation of the APM presented the accuracy of its optimization results (cruise  speed and fuel\n\nconsumption)  and  underlying  parameters  (drag  coefficient, specific range) for several cruise optimization criteria: maximum range, long range, and economy. Larger errors have been  observed  in  the  speed  estimation  compared  to  the  fuel estimation,  which  could  be  explained  by  the  flatness  of  the specific  range  curve  in  the  vicinity  of  the  MRC  and  LRC optimum  speeds.  From  the  errors  measured  in  integrated optimization  results  (average:  2%,  maximum:  5%,  on  both speed  and  fuel),  the  evaluated  APM  was  deemed  suitable  for cruise speed optimization in ATM  simulations and environmental  impact  assessments,  and  not  suitable  for  onboard  applications  and  business  and  economic  studies.  The results  from  this  study  will  guide  future  evolutions  of  this APM, such as improvements of its drag and fuel flow models.", "metadata": {"source_path": "data/raw/applicability-modern-apm-to-traj-opt.pdf", "doc_type": "pdf", "title": "applicability-modern-apm-to-traj-opt", "page_count": 9, "topic": "general", "chunk_tokens": 387}, "token_count": 387}

Many  simulation  environments  lack actual  information  on  aircraft,  airline  or  airspacespecific operational procedures: they resort to generic procedures  to  navigate  the  simulated  aircraft,  which may  result  in  unsatisfying  aircraft  behaviours.  A methodology has been developed by EUROCONTROL to improve the aircraft behaviour model in its large-scale and real-time air traffic management simulation  system,  by  identifying  specific  aircraft operation parameters from historical radar data. The simulator  has  been  adapted  to  take  these  aircraft operation parameters into account, and the methodology  was  applied  and  tested  during  the  last two simulations which took place at the EUROCONTROL Experimental Centre in 2010. The results of using operationally-tuned parameters during those simulations demonstrate that the analysis  of  flight  recordings  can  bring  valuable information about numerous flight behaviour parameters,  and  that  the  use  of  detailed  flight behaviour models based on the parameters identified from  the  recordings  can  improve  the  accuracy  of aircraft  modeling  enough  that  air  traffic  controllers liken the simulated traffic to a real traffic.", "metadata": {"source_path": "data/raw/bada-enhanced-realism-atc-simulations-2010.pdf", "doc_type": "pdf", "title": "bada-enhanced-realism-atc-simulations-2010", "page_count": 13, "topic": "## ENHANCEMENT IN REALISM OF ATC SIMULATIONS BY IMPROVING AIRCRAFT BEHAVIOUR MODELS", "chunk_tokens": 344}, "token_count": 344}

This is the role that an Aircraft Performance Model (APM) takes on board.\n\nThe  principal  objectives  of  an  APM  are  to provide  realistic,  accurate  and  complete  aircraft performance models:\n\n- · Capable of supporting accurate computation  of  the  geometric,  kinematic and kinetic aspects of the aircraft behaviour,\n- · Applicable to a wide set of aircraft types, over  the  entire  operation  flight  envelope, and in all phases of flight,\n- · With  reasonable  complexity,  maintainability and computing requirements.\n\neATG  uses the Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) [1],  an  APM  developed  and  maintained  by EUROCONTROL. BADA is based on a mass-varying, kinetic approach that models an aircraft as a point and requires  the  modeling  of  underlying  forces  that  cause aircraft  motion  [2]. eATG  implements  the  BADA model algorithms based on the Total Energy Model (TEM),  which  provides  the  relation  between  thrust, speed and rate of climb/descent used to compute the aircraft performances  depending  on  the  aircraft control law. BADA also provides a limitation model which defines  the  flight  envelope  in  terms  of  speed and altitude.\n\nThe  current  version  of  BADA  provides  111 aircraft  type  models  developed  from  manufacturer aircraft  reference  data  and  referred  to  as  original models. Another 207 aircraft types may be simulated by using an equivalent to an original BADA model.", "metadata": {"source_path": "data/raw/bada-enhanced-realism-atc-simulations-2010.pdf", "doc_type": "pdf", "title": "bada-enhanced-realism-atc-simulations-2010", "page_count": 13, "topic": "## BADA Aircraft Performance Model", "chunk_tokens": 388}, "token_count": 388}

{"text": "## BADA Airline Procedure Model\n\nAlongside  the  aircraft performance  model, which  focuses  on  the  aircraft  itself,  BADA  also provides  a  generic  aircraft  behaviour  model,  called AiRline Procedure Model (ARPM), which focuses on how  the  aircraft  is  operated. The  definition  of  the standard airline procedures in BADA is driven by a requirement  to  provide  information  on  nominal aircraft operations to different simulation and modeling  tools  for  various  ATM  applications. The way  an  aircraft is operated, however, varies significantly in function of specific airspace procedures and operating policies of locally dominant airlines: the speed schedules provided by the BADA standard  airline  procedure  model  may  thus  differ from  specific  aircraft  operations  in  a  particular geographical location or airspace.\n\nFigure 4. BADA ARPM Structure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  BADA  ARPM  structure,  illustrated  on Figure  4,  has  been  inspired  by  standard  operational procedures  published  in  aircraft  flight  manuals  and Aeronautical Information Publications (AIP). It provides nominal aircraft operating speeds in function  of  altitude,  through  a  set  of  formulas  and coefficients  [1]. To  fit  the  general  behaviour  of\n\ndifferent  aircraft,  the  formulas  depend  on  the  flight phase (climb, cruise or descent) and the engine type (jet, turboprop  or  piston).

{"text": "## Applications\n\nSince  the  power  available  to  the  aircraft  is limited, climb performance is reduced during accelerations. For example, during an acceleration in the  climb  phase  using  an  ESF  of  0.3,  70%  of  the power  goes  into  the  acceleration,  leaving  only  30% for  the  climb. When  the  BADA  ARPM  is  used, several accelerations occur in the course of a typical climb (ex: 6 accelerations for a jet), and the aircraft consequently spends a non-negligible part of the first minutes of flight in this 'reduced performance' state. Accurate  modeling  of  this  behaviour  may  thus  be needed  in  simulations,  and  the  default  ESF  values provided by BADA for the speed changes may need some  adjustments  depending  on  the  simulated environment  (ex:  terminal  maneuvring  area  (TMA)\n\nenvironments,  where  accurate  aircraft  behaviour  in departure and approach phases may be required).\n\nFigure  6  illustrates  the  impact  of  the  choice  of ESF  for  accelerations,  by  comparing  the  simulated vertical and horizontal speeds of a jet aircraft during the first 6 minutes of flight using an ESF value, from top  to  bottom,  of  0  (maximum  acceleration),  0.3 (BADA proposed value) and 0.6 (slower accelerations).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFigure 6.", "metadata": {"source_path": "data/raw/bada-enhanced-realism-atc-simulations-2010.pdf", "doc_type": "pdf", "title": "bada-enhanced-realism-atc-simulations-2010", "page_count": 13, "topic": "## Applications", "chunk_tokens": 348}, "token_count": 348}

Such  discrepancies  are  expected  since  the simulator uses both a generic behaviour model and a pseudo-pilot for the navigation of the aircraft, neither of  which  knows  about  the  detailed  airline  policies and  aircraft  handling  characteristics  applicable  to each particular flight.\n\nIn order to fulfill controllers' need for realism, it was  first  attempted  to  gain  knowledge  about  the specific airline procedures,  that  could  then  be tentatively  reproduced  in  the  simulator.

ATM research and development activities  and  Air  Traffic  Control  (ATC)  systems  that  require information on aircraft performances rely on a substitute of the real  aircraft,  in  the  form  of  an  aircraft  performance  model (APM). While  several  APM  for  fixed-wing  aircraft  are commonly  used  by  the  ATM  community,  no  such  model  is available for rotorcraft. The flight dynamics of rotorcraft have been extensively studied [1,2,3,4], resulting in very detailed six degrees of freedom (DoF) models. The computing requirements associated with these models may however be too high for typical ATM applications, and the datasets available to complement  these  theoretical  models  cover  only  a  limited number of helicopter types. A simplified theoretical model was proposed in [7], but it still requires iterative computations and was  validated  only  on  scale  helicopter  models. A  recent research effort [8] does propose a rotorcraft performance model that  has  been  designed  for  environmental  assessments  and could  meet  other  ATM  requirements,  but  the  corresponding datasets have not been made available to the ATM community.\n\nIn  an  attempt  to  fill  this  gap,  the  authors  have  developed Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) Family H [10], an extension to\n\nthe  BADA  APM  [9]  dedicated  to  helicopter  aircraft.", "metadata": {"source_path": "data/raw/bada-family-h.pdf", "doc_type": "pdf", "title": "bada-family-h", "page_count": 8, "topic": "## I.

The  physical model  is  based  on  a  mass-varying  kinetic  approach,  which considers the aircraft as a point and requires the modelling of underlying  forces  that  cause  aircraft  motion.  The  APM  is structured  into  four  models:  action,  motion,  operations  and limitations.\n\n## A. Action model\n\nThe  action  model  allows  the  computation  of  the  forces acting  on  the  aircraft  via  their  associated  powers.  It  includes three  categories  of  actions:  aerodynamic  (power  required), propulsive (engine power and fuel consumption) and gravitational (weight).", "metadata": {"source_path": "data/raw/bada-family-h.pdf", "doc_type": "pdf", "title": "bada-family-h", "page_count": 8, "topic": "## II.

Power required\n\nThe  behaviour  of  the  power  required  model  of  BADA H can  be  compared  with  the  theoretical  behaviour  described  in previous research [1,4]. Fig. 1 illustrates the effect of airspeed and aircraft mass on the power required for level flight at sea level and ISA conditions, for the H2 model. The shape of the plot  is  consistent  with  similar  plots  from  [1,4]  for  both  the airspeed and mass effects. The power required decreases from hover  to  low  airspeed,  because  of  the  reduction  in  induced power, and increases from low to high airspeed, because of the increase in parasite power. An increase in aircraft mass results in  an  increase  in  power  required,  and  this  effect  is  more pronounced  at  low  airspeeds.  Fig.  2  illustrates  the  effect  of airspeed and pressure altitude on the power required for level flight  at  medium  mass  and  ISA  conditions,  for  the  same  H2 model. The shape  of  the  plot  is  again  consistent  with  similar plots  from  [1,4]:  the  power  required  increases  with  altitude from  hover  to  low  airspeed,  but  decreases  with  altitude  at higher airspeeds.\n\n5\n\nFig. 1.

Hover ceiling\n\nThe hover ceiling represents the maximum altitude at which a  helicopter  can  hover  at  given  engine  power  rating,  aircraft mass and air temperature: at this altitude and zero airspeed, the power required equals the power available (unless hover ceiling is  limited  by  the  maximum  operating  altitude,  but  such  flight conditions have been discarded from the following comparisons).

{"text": "## I. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe evaluation of the feasibility and benefits of new air traffic management (ATM) initiatives often relies on simulation tools, in which trajectory predictors (TP) play a key role. Trajectory prediction is also the cornerstone of the evolution of the ATM system towards a new paradigm based on the use of decision support tools (DTS) to assist air traffic control. This new concept is a key enabler of trajectory based operations (TBO), which allow airspace users to collaborate with ATM services providers to execute their operations.\n\nAs defined in [1], trajectory prediction is the process to estimate the future trajectory of an aircraft through calculation by using mathematical models of the different implied components such as aircraft, meteorology or ATM systems. A TP is a tool that implements this functionality. The quality of trajectory predictions is closely related to the accuracy of the aircraft performance models (APM) -although other factors also affect the quality of the predictions such as intent modelling or weather forecasts.\n\nThe most important elements of APM include aircraft power plant (thrust and fuel consumption essentially) and aerody-\n\nnamic drag modelling. Recent works have focused on the derivation of thrust models using different approaches, such as in [2]. In [3] and [4] propulsive models are developed using genetic algorithms and neural networks. References [5] and [6] explain how to model airplane fuel consumption in terminal areas to support trajectory prediction in ATM simulation for environmental and operational decision-making.\n\nOne of the most widespread APM databases for ATM research and assessment purposes is the Base of Aircraft Data (BADA), whose features and capabilities are presented in [7] and [8]. BADA has been used in many cases for ATM research applications, such as the trajectory computation infrastructure in [9] and EUROCONTROL's large scale real-time simulation platform ESCAPE (EUROCONTROL Simulation Capability and Platform for Experimentation).", "metadata": {"source_path": "data/raw/modelling-flexible-thrust-performance.pdf", "doc_type": "pdf", "title": "modelling-flexible-thrust-performance", "page_count": 8, "topic": "## I.

{"text": "Also many operational applications make use of BADA, such as the NASA's center terminal radar approach control (TRACON) automation system (CTAS), [10]. Another widespread source of performance data is the Aircraft Noise and Performance (ANP) database, whose primary purpose is supporting aircraft noise assessments. The ANP database is an online data resource accompanying the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) Doc 29, 3rd Edition [11], and ICAO Doc 9911 guidance documents on airport noise contour modelling.\n\nAlthough the aforementioned models and methodologies provide a solid framework to model conventional take-off operations, none of them provides a validated and generic methodology to model take-offs with flexible thrust, i.e. executed at less than full thrust power to reduce engine wear and noise. In order to produce useful ATM simulations that keep fidelity with real operational scenarios, it is necessary to model flexible thrust, in particular for an accurate estimation of noise, fuel consumption and resulting emissions during takeoff. The implementation of reduced thrust models can support ATM development by enhancing realism and fidelity in the generation of what-if scenarios to assess new ATM concepts, especially in terms of environmental impact assessment.\n\nIn [11] a very simple approach to compute flexible thrust was proposed. This formula was derived from Flight Data Recorder (FDR) data analyses that showed a correlation between thrust reduction and the ratio of the actual take-\n\noff weight to the regulated take-off weight. This method was proven inaccurate in [12], where the results obtained with the previous relationship were compared to the thrust reduction data generated with official manufacturer's takeoff performance software. The shortcomings of such a model leave a gap in thrust modelling for take-off as no validated and generic model for reduced thrust is available nowadays.\n\nThis paper proposes a methodology for modelling flexible thrust with the assumed temperature (AT) method by combining an AT polynomial model identified from manufacturer take-off performance data and a thrust model taken from typical ATM performance databases.", "metadata": {"source_path": "data/raw/modelling-flexible-thrust-performance.pdf", "doc_type": "pdf", "title": "modelling-flexible-thrust-performance", "page_count": 8, "topic": "general", "chunk_tokens": 391}, "token_count": 391}

{"text": "## II. REDUCED THRUST OPERATIONS\n\nThe required thrust for take-off depends on several factors, such as runway length, take-off weight (TOW), wind conditions, runway elevation and slope, or outside air temperature (OAT). In the majority of take-off procedures the full-rated thrust 1 is typically higher than the thrust strictly required for a safe take-off [12]. Thus, in those situations it would be possible to take-off with a thrust level lower than this maximum. This procedure is known as reduced thrust -or flexible thrustoperations, which have the advantage of extending the engines' life usage while reducing engine maintenance costs.\n\nThrust reduction in take-off can be accomplished by either using a manufacturer-provided engine reduced rate -or derate- or using the assumed temperature method, where the thrust reduction is achieved by selecting the rated thrust for a temperature that is higher than the OAT. This is the most common method for take-off thrust reduction.", "metadata": {"source_path": "data/raw/modelling-flexible-thrust-performance.pdf", "doc_type": "pdf", "title": "modelling-flexible-thrust-performance", "page_count": 8, "topic": "## II.

{"text": "## A. The Assumed Temperature Method\n\nIn order to protect the engine from damage and excessive wear and deterioration, the engine manufacturer provides an engine rating, which limits the maximum certified thrust that an engine can provide under certain conditions. This thrust limit is a consequence of the operational limitations imposed by the engine's combustion inlet pressure, the turbine inlet temperature and the fan rotation speed. The combination of such limitations provides a maximum allowable thrust that depends on the air temperature, and contains a pressure-limited and a temperature-limited zones.\n\nA maximum thrust rating -full-rate- is typically established by the manufacturer so that the aforementioned thrust limitations are fulfilled and a safety margin is kept. This situation is depicted in Fig. 1. The thrust rating contains a flatrated and a temperature-rated area. In the latter, the maximum allowable thrust decreases with the OAT. The temperature at which the temperature-dependent rating starts is the kink temperature T K.\n\n1 The full-rated is the maximum thrust that the engines are capable of producing for a certified take-off thrust under the existing conditions of temperature and pressure altitude.\n\nFig. 1. Thrust limitations due to external temperature and inlet pressure.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn reduced thrust operations, the minimum thrust required for a safe take-off T min is computed based on the takeoff conditions. Then, it may be possible to find a certain temperature within the temp-rated zone so that the maximum thrust provided by the thrust rating corresponds to T min. If that is the case, this temperature is introduced in the flight management system (FMS) as a fictitious OAT -or assumed temperature (AT). As a result, the engine control system will establish a functioning regime for the engine as if the air intake temperature was AT.", "metadata": {"source_path": "data/raw/modelling-flexible-thrust-performance.pdf", "doc_type": "pdf", "title": "modelling-flexible-thrust-performance", "page_count": 8, "topic": "## A.

Note that the maximum allowable AT depends on the takeoff distance available (TODA), and other variables such as wind conditions, runway slope and contamination, flaps/slats configuration used, obstacles, etc.", "metadata": {"source_path": "data/raw/modelling-flexible-thrust-performance.pdf", "doc_type": "pdf", "title": "modelling-flexible-thrust-performance", "page_count": 8, "topic": "general", "chunk_tokens": 104}, "token_count": 104}
{"text": "## B. Benefits of Reduced Thrust Operations\n\nThe usage of reduced thrust operations is a widespread practice in the majority of current take-off operations in civil aviation. In 2009 the proportion of engine maintenance to direct maintenance cost was 43% for the 40 maintenance cost task force (MCTF) participating airlines [13]. As engine maintenance material cost (MMC) is a significant part of the total maintenance expenses, using methods to optimize the aircraft engines' life usage has become a common practice for today's airlines. As exposed in [14], a reduction in the engines Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) can noticeably reduce engine deterioration and life usage, leading to savings in MMC of about 25% for a reduction of 7% of the EGT, and up to a 40% for an 18% EGT reduction [15]. These results encourage airlines to operate engines at the minimum thrust level required for the safe operation of the aircraft. Reduced thrust operations are amongst the most widespread solutions.\n\n## III. MODEL DEFINITION\n\nIn order to provide a complete framework to model flexible thrust operations using AT, two mathematical models are required. In first place, the AT that is used under given take-off conditions needs to be modelled. In second place, it is required\n\na thrust model that captures the effect of the AT to compute reduced thrust. In this paper, a polynomial AT model identified from manufacturer take-off performance data is proposed. Then, the BADA and ANP-based thrust models are tested to provide realistic thrust reductions when the obtained AT is used to compute thrust.", "metadata": {"source_path": "data/raw/modelling-flexible-thrust-performance.pdf", "doc_type": "pdf", "title": "modelling-flexible-thrust-performance", "page_count": 8, "topic": "## B. Benefits of Reduced Thrust Operations", "chunk_tokens": 320}, "token_count": 320}
{"text": "## A. The Assumed Temperature Model\n\nThe exact AT that is used in a particular take-off is in essence not a deterministic variable, since the operator can choose any temperature within the allowed range. However, reduced thrust operations aim to optimize the TODA by using the minimum thrust setting that allows a safe take-off, i.e. a thrust level so that the take-off distance (TOD) equals the TODA. Consequently, it can be assumed that an operator will always use the maximum AT possible, so that the minimum thrust T min is used and TOD=TODA. This maximum AT can be modelled as a deterministic function of the take-off conditions, and will be hereinafter referred to as simply AT.\n\nThe take-off requirements basically consider the capability of the aircraft to avoid ground-based obstacles by achieving a minimum certified rate of climb in case of engine failure. These limitations define the maximum thrust reduction that can be applied so that a safe take-off can be performed, and therefore determine the AT. The factors affecting such limitations are:\n\n- · Airframe configuration: High lift devices (flaps/slats) have an effect on the aircraft lift, and consequently on the induced drag. When flaps angle is increased, the stall speed is reduced and so is the required take-off speed. Additionally, the increased drag increases the required thrust, limiting the allowable thrust reduction obtainable with the AT method. Flap deployment reduces the TOD.\n- · Take-off weight: The TOW determines the required lift to overcome the weight force. Higher TOW results in an increased lift-off speed, which leads to an increased TOD. Consequently, higher TOW reduces the applicability of the AT method.\n- · Runway elevation: Thrust and lift are proportional to air density, which is determined by the atmospheric pressure, OAT and humidity at the considered elevation. At higher elevations, atmospheric pressure and air density are lower, causing a reduction in the engine capability to produce thrust.", "metadata": {"source_path": "data/raw/modelling-flexible-thrust-performance.pdf", "doc_type": "pdf", "title": "modelling-flexible-thrust-performance", "page_count": 8, "topic": "## A.

{"text": "Hence the applicability of the AT method is more restrictive at higher airport elevations.\n- · Outside air temperature: The efficiency of jet engines depends on the OAT. For higher OAT the air density drops, resulting in a reduction in the thrust produced by the engine and consequently in an increased TOD.\n- · Wind: Lift and drag directly depend on airspeed, whereas the TOD depends on ground speed. Headwind reduces ground speed, decreasing the TOD.\n- · Runway length: Greater thrust reduction can be applied to longer runways, since they imply a higher TODA.\n- · Runway slope: A positive slope produces degradation in the acceleration phase. In this way, the AT would be lower\n\nin order to obtain more thrust than in negative slope. Higher speed is required for take-off, increasing the TOD.\n\n- · Obstacles around the airport: TOD is limited since a certain rate of climb and take-off path angle are needed to ensure a safe margin over obstacles. This affects the thrust required and therefore the maximum AT that can be used in the operation.\n- · Runway contamination: Runway surface contamination conditions impact the grip of the landing gear's tires, increasing the TOD. According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations in [16], operating with reduced thrust is prohibited under such conditions.\n\nIn this paper, the AT is modelled as a polynomial function of the take-off conditions identified from manufacturer take-off performance data.

Obstacles depend on the particular runway environment where the takeoff operation takes place, therefore it was also not included in the model. The results presented in [12] showed that the OAT has no effect on the calculation of the maximum AT. Since reduced thrust operations are forbidden in contaminated runways [16], runway contamination is not considered as an input to the model.

{"text": "## B. The Thrust Model\n\nTypically, trajectory predictors for ATM research use threedegrees-of-freedom (3DoF) approaches to model aircraft performance. Such models simplify aircraft dynamics to three translations, neglecting angular rates and moments, which have faster dynamics. This simplification dramatically reduces the complexity of the model while providing sufficient accuracy for ATM simulations. Ref. [19] provides an excellent review on the main APM and data sources commonly used for ATM applications. From the models therein mentioned, the thrust models of BADA and ECAC Doc. 29 / ICAO Doc 9911 guidance documents (with ANP data) were observed to be especially interesting for the purposes of this study.\n\n1) The BADA Thrust Model: BADA is an APM specifically intended for ATM applications created and maintained by EUROCONTROL in cooperation with aircraft manufacturers\n\nand operating airlines. It is a total energy model (TEM) based on a 3DoF kinetic point-mass approach. The version BADA 3 provides close to 100% coverage of aircraft types in the ECAC area, whereas the newly developed BADA 4 offers a coverage of about 70% [20]. Since BADA is a de facto standard in ATM trajectory prediction and simulation, its use for flexible thrust modelling may ease the applicability of the model in many modern TPs. For this paper, a BADA-like thrust model of a B737 was generated from manufacturer data. The model specification hereby used was an experimental version of BADA 4 [21], which may not match official releases of BADA.\n\nBADA 4 provides thrust models for turbofan, turboprop and piston engines.

{"text": "## IV. MODEL VALIDATION\n\nOnce the mathematical framework needed to model all the relevant aspects of reduced thrust operations was defined, the validity and accuracy of the selected AT and thrust models was determined through validation. The AT model was tested to provide reliable and accurate results by comparison with thrust performance data provided by BR&TE. The BADA and ANP-based thrust models were tested to provide realistic thrust reduction when the AT obtained with the previous model was used as a temperature input. This validation was supported with climb out performance data and simulation software provided by BR&TE.\n\n## A. Validation of the Assumed Temperature Model\n\nThe validation of the AT model was carried out for two narrow-body and one wide-body typical Boeing aircraft. Boeing's Standard Take-off Analysis Software (STAS) was used to generate a set of reference AT data. STAS is the official Boeing's take-off performance tool, and provides take-off performance tables from which the AT was derived for the combinations of take-off conditions listed in Table I. Parameter identification was carried out by the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) method to identify the polynomial coefficients and AT ( i ) max in (1) and (2) for the three aircraft models. The AT identification data was obtained from STAS as stated above. Polynomials of first, second and third order were identified for each aircraft model. Finally, such polynomials were used to compute the AT for the combinations of parameters in Table I. The accuracy of the model for different polynomial orders was assessed by comparison of the polynomial results to the reference AT data obtained from STAS. The results of this validation will be presented in section V.", "metadata": {"source_path": "data/raw/modelling-flexible-thrust-performance.pdf", "doc_type": "pdf", "title": "modelling-flexible-thrust-performance", "page_count": 8, "topic": "## IV.

{"text": "## B. Validation of the Thrust Models\n\nIn this paper the BADA and ANP-based thrust models were tested to provide a realistic reduced thrust when an AT is used a temperature input to the models.\n\n1) Using Assumed Temperature with BADA: To compute flexible thrust with the AT method, T was substituted by the AT in (8). Note that, in such cases, the physical parameters depending on the OAT -i.e. M in (4)- can still be computed with the actual OAT, so that the AT only has an effect on the throttle level and does not affect the expressions where physical phenomena are modelled. This fact ensures that, whereas thrust is reduced by limiting the value of δ T, the actual OAT is still taken into account to capture, for instance, the effect of air density and temperature on the thrust produced by the engine.\n\n2) Using Assumed Temperature with the ANP-based Thrust Model: Reduced thrust with ANP data was computed by substituting T by the AT in (9). Unlike BADA, the ANPbased thrust model contains a single temperature input. Consequently, the substitution of T by the AT results in an added error, since not only the throttle level limitation is affected by the increased temperature, but also the physical process of thrust production is considered to happen at OAT=AT -which is not the case in real operations.\n\n3) Experimental Setup: For the validation of the thrust models, 56,700 different take-off procedures were simulated with the Boeing Climbout Program (BCOP), the standardized software used by Boeing and customer airlines for take-off and approach studies in terminal area. BCOP uses the standard low speed Boeing performance databases, which are based upon flight test data and use a Boeing's private specification.", "metadata": {"source_path": "data/raw/modelling-flexible-thrust-performance.pdf", "doc_type": "pdf", "title": "modelling-flexible-thrust-performance", "page_count": 8, "topic": "## B.

MATLAB was used to generate SCAP files and launch BCOP. Each takeoff procedure represents one particular airframe and engine combination for a set of given take-off conditions (i.e. weight, runway length and elevation, wind, OAT, AT and flap setting).\n\nThe take-off trajectories were defined in several segments. The thrust setting used throughout all the operation was the maximum take-off thrust (MTKF) or TOGA with flexible thrust reduction. The take-off segment encompassed from brakes release until reaching 35ft over the runway threshold at the safety take-off speed of V2 plus 10 kt. This segment was followed by a constant CAS climb until gear retraction, a constant CAS climb until the acceleration height of 400 ft, and finally a constant altitude acceleration with flap retraction until achieving clean configuration. Subsequent climb segments are typically operated at maximum continuous thrust (MCT) and are not of interest for this study because thrust reduction does not apply anymore.

{"text": "## A. Results of the Assumed Temperature Model Validation\n\nAT polynomials of first, second and third order -with 5, 15 and 35 coefficients respectively- were identified and evaluated for each aircraft model and flaps configuration. Fig. 2 shows an example of the AT estimation for a first order polynomial and fixed flaps, wind and TOW conditions. Note that the maximum AT has a flat region that is accounted for in the AT polynomial model with the value AT ( i ) max. This flat region has an unique value for the dependencies of AT with runway length, wind and TOW, but has different values depending on the airfield elevation (see Fig. 2b). As a consequence, there are different possible choices for the value of AT ( i ) max.\n\nIn this paper different AT ( i ) max values were considered separately: the lowest and highest values, and the value that applied to the widest range of elevations (i.e. 65 · C in Fig. 2b). Different model accuracies were observed for different choices of AT ( i ) max. However, no single option was observed to simultaneously provide the best accuracy for all aircraft models and polynomial orders. Since the AT ( i ) max offering the best accuracy could not be determined a priori , the solution for its choice was to compute the overall accuracy for all possible AT ( i ) max and choose the value that provides the best fitting.\n\nThe root mean square error (RMSE) between the AT model and the STAS data was observed to decrease for higher-order polynomials and higher flap angles.

{"text": "## B. Results of the Thrust Models Validation\n\nThe validation of the BADA and ANP models was based on the computation of thrust and thrust reduction as a function of AT for different conditions of airspeed, OAT and pressure altitude obtained from the climb out simulations.

The thrust reduction was defined as the percentage reduction of net thrust achieved with a given AT relative to the baseline or full-rated thrust under the same conditions when no AT was applied. The baseline thrust was taken from BCOP for a take-off with AT=OAT. The thrust reduction for a given set of conditions of airspeed, OAT and pressure altitude ( n ) was defined as\n\nTR ( n ) = T ( n ) BCOP ( OAT ) -T ( n ) ( AT ) T ( n ) BCOP ( OAT ) · 100 (11)\n\nwhere TR ( n ) is the thrust reduction for the given conditions, T ( n ) ( AT ) the net thrust obtained from either BADA, ANP or BCOP for a given AT, and T ( n ) BCOP ( OAT ) the baseline thrust obtained from BCOP for AT=OAT.\n\nDuring the validation process, the BADA 4 polynomial formula for the maximum take-off regime provided very high thrust values when used at speeds lower than Mach 0.235 and close to 0. These inaccuracies were found to be caused by overfitting of the experimental thrust model in regions with high density of flight test data, and have been corrected in newer versions of BADA. As a consequence, only datapoints at speeds higher than Mach 0.235 were considered in the validation.\n\nFig. 3 shows the obtained thrust reduction for a specific set of take-off conditions at a given speed as a function of the AT.

This AT has been validated to provide realistic thrust reduction when used as a temperature input for BADA and ANP-based thrust models without significant degradation of their overall accuracy.\n\nIn sight of these promising results, further validation of the AT polynomial identification methodology shall be conducted in the future for a wider range of aircraft models. The use of the methodology proposed in this paper in ATM simulations can enable ATM assessment tools to reproduce current takeoff operations with better fidelity, so that more realistic what-if scenarios can be assessed and more reliable data can be made available to support decision-making in the development and deployment of future ATM concepts and technologies.\n\n## ACKNOWLEDGMENT\n\nThe authors would like to thank Mar'ıa Gonz'alez Arias for her valuable contribution to the development of the AT model.

INTRODUCTION\n\nAircraft is one of the key actors in the Air Traffic Management (ATM) system. Consequently, ATM Research and Development (R&D) activities or Air Traffic Control (ATC) systems that require information on aircraft performances rely on a substitute of the real aircraft. This is the role that Aircraft Performance Model (APM) takes on board.\n\nPrincipal objectives of an APM are to provide realistic, accurate and complete aircraft performance models:\n\n- · Capable of supporting accurate computation of the geometric, kinematic and kinetic aspects of the aircraft behaviour,\n- · Applicable to a wide set of aircraft types, over the entire operation flight envelope, and in all phases of flight,\n- · With reasonable complexity, maintainability and computing requirements.\n\nThere are several existing approaches to aircraft performance modelling nowadays. Kinetic approach models aircraft forces, while kinematic approach directly models the aircraft flight path characteristics without attempting to model the underlying physics. Typical examples of APM that are used today are introduced and described in [ 1 ] .\n\nThis paper describes Base of Aircraft Data (BADA), an APM, developed and maintained by EUROCONTROL. The paper is structured into eight sections, the introduction being the first one. The second section provides an overview of BADA, its structure and its components with their roles and responsibilities. The third section explains the aircraft model instance generation taking into account the aircraft reference performance data needed and the coefficient identification process. The fourth and fifth sections give an insight into the state-of-the-art and main features of the two existing model families, BADA 3 and 4. Sections six and seven provide examples of BADA application and describe the way to access it.

{"text": "## 2.1. BADA APM\n\nThe APM adopted by BADA is based on a mass-varying, kinetic approach. This approach models an aircraft as a point and requires the modelling of underlying forces that cause aircraft motion. As depicted in Figure 1, the BADA APM is structured into four models, namely Actions, Motion, Operations and Limitations.\n\nThe action model allows the computation of the forces acting on the aircraft which cause its motion. There are three categories of actions: aerodynamic (namely drag D and lift L), propulsive (thrust T) and gravitational (weight W). Since BADA accounts for mass variation, the propulsive model provides an associated model to compute fuel consumption F. The corresponding mathematical models are expressed in the form of polynomial expressions.\n\nTotal Energy Model (TEM) relates to the geometrical, kinematic and kinetic aspects of the aircraft motion , allowing the aircraft performances and trajectory to be calculated. TEM equates the rate of work done by forces acting on the aircraft to the rate of increase in potential and kinetic energy, that is:\n\n( T -D )v = W ˙ h + m v ˙ v (1)\n\nwhere h is altitude, ˙ h is vertical speed, v is true airspeed (TAS) and m is aircraft mass.\n\nFigure 1.", "metadata": {"source_path": "data/raw/overview-bada-apm.pdf", "doc_type": "pdf", "title": "overview-bada-apm", "page_count": 17, "topic": "## 2.1.

The computed aircraft trajectory is, then, the result of concatenating the solutions of a sequence of such motion problems.\n\nAlthough the ODE system above governs any possible aircraft motion, different ways of operating the aircraft result in different trajectories. For instance, flying constant Mach number [ 2 ] leads to the following specific form of Equation (3):\n\nESF = ( 1 + /afii9837 R /afii9826 T 2 g M 2 ) -1 (5)\n\nwhere /afii9837 is the air adiabatic index, R is the specific gas constant, /afii9826 T is the temperature gradient of the particular atmosphere layer considered and M is the Mach number.

{"text": "## 2.2. BADA airline procedure model ( ARPM )\n\nThe definition of the standard airline procedures in BADA is driven by a requirement to provide information on nominal aircraft operations to different simulation and modelling tools for various ATM applications. It is widely recognized that the way an aircraft is operated varies significantly in function of specific airspace procedures and operating policies of locally dominant airlines. That is the reason why the resulting speed schedules of the BADA standard airline procedure model may differ from a particular geographical location or an aerospace's specific aircraft operation. Details about the BADA ARPM may be found in reference documents [ 2, 3 ] .\n\n## 3. SPECIFIC AIRCRAFT MODEL INSTANCE GENERATION\n\nEach aircraft model in BADA is described with a set of coefficients that are used by the Action, Limitations, Operations and Airline procedure models. The process of specific aircraft model instance generation aims at\n\nidentifying coefficients of mathematical models with the objective to achieve the best fit between calculated and reference aircraft performance parameters. As a result, the set of aircraft coefficients is identified to describe a specific aircraft type. Although each aircraft model instance is generated for a specific aircraft type and version, it is identified only by a 4-character designation code assigned by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) [ 4 ] , e.g. the A319 instance in BADA 3.7 is based on the Airbus A319-131 aircraft equipped with two V2522-A5 engines.", "metadata": {"source_path": "data/raw/overview-bada-apm.pdf", "doc_type": "pdf", "title": "overview-bada-apm", "page_count": 17, "topic": "## 2.2.

Reference data requirements\n\nTo enable the identification of all the coefficients that describe the aircraft model instance, a number of aircraft performance data items is required. This data can be divided into two categories: technical specification data and performance data. Technical specification data consists of general aircraft characteristics (model, engine, limitations and dimensions), operating characteristics (nominal operating speeds) and aerodynamic configurations. Performance data consist of aircraft flight profile data which provide information on required time, distance and fuel to climb / descend to / from flight level (FL) at specific conditions of aircraft weight, operating speed, atmospheric conditions, engine settings, etc.\n\nPrecision and granularity of data values, together with data coverage of the aircraft flight envelope, have the highest impact on the BADA model quality. The performance data are considered to be of low quality when: the data covers only a limited part of the aircraft flight envelope; data are available only for a small number of flight levels; time to climb or descend is rounded to the nearest minute. High quality aircraft performance reference data provide data points for a complete range of aircraft operating conditions in terms of weight, speeds, different atmospheric conditions and associated operating regimes with a high level of data granularity (number of data points) and data precision.", "metadata": {"source_path": "data/raw/overview-bada-apm.pdf", "doc_type": "pdf", "title": "overview-bada-apm", "page_count": 17, "topic": "general", "chunk_tokens": 304}, "token_count": 304}
{"text": "## 3.2. Action model coefficients identification\n\nBADA APM requires modelling of thrust and drag, while fuel flow is modelled as a function of thrust. As the original aircraft data for thrust, drag and thrust-specific fuel consumption are not easily available, a choice was made to use aircraft profile data for BADA action model identification.\n\nThe ODE system formed by Equations (2) and (4) together with Equation (6) below provides the way to compute flight profiles based on BADA, once the model coefficients for thrust, drag and fuel consumption are known.\n\n˙ r = v · cos /afii9828 (6)\n\nwhere ˙ r is the horizontal speed and /afii9828 is the flight path angle.\n\nFigure 2 depicts the model instance identification process.\n\nThe objective of the model identification process is to obtain the BADA APM coefficients from a set of known flight data points. Since the ODE system is the law that governs trajectory generation according to BADA model, it can be used for coefficient identification purposes: left side values of expressions (2), (4) and (6) are the observed values, while right side values are estimated values by means of the BADA model.\n\nThe better the expressions above estimate the observed derivatives ˙ h and ˙ r , the more accurately the trajectory resulting from integration of such derivatives will fit the observed ones.\n\nThe adopted optimization solution is least-squares (LS) solution that minimizes the sum of square errors (SSE) of vertical speed ˙ h as defined in expression:\n\nSSE ˙ h = n ∑ i = 1 [ ˙ h i -( T i -D i ) v i m i g ESF i ] 2 (7)\n\nCopyright q 2010 EUROCONTROL.

In that case, the SSE is computed as\n\nSSE ˙ m = n ∑ i = 1 [˙ m i + F i ] 2 (8)\n\nTo ensure that obtained coefficients robustly represent aircraft behaviour over normal operation conditions, various flight profiles that cover operations of aircraft for different speeds, aircraft masses and atmosphere conditions are used. The available aircraft performance reference data do not always cater for this requirement of aircraft flight envelope coverage. In this case an aircraft model can be identified, but its fidelity can only be assessed and guaranteed for the range of reference data conditions.\n\nValidation of the resulting coefficients for a specific aircraft type is also done by visual analysis of the plots containing reference against computed trajectories.

The design decisions were made taking into consideration availability and quality of the existing aircraft performance reference data and computing resources.\n\nSince the time BADA 3 was first developed, applications relying on the APM have broadened significantly with requirements to provide more advanced features to support ATM modelling and simulation needs. The new requirements relate to the accuracy of the modelled aircraft performances, the coverage of the complete aircraft operation envelope, the flight phases that can be represented and the type of operations that an APM can support. The advanced model optimization tools and today's available high quality reference data have been used to study the ability of the BADA 3 model to capture aircraft performances over the whole flight envelope and to identify levels of accuracy that are achievable. This study has confirmed that the BADA 3 model with its underlying mathematical models cannot provide accurate modelling over the entire flight envelope. This finding has been a driver for the development of BADA 4, with the objective to accurately model aircraft performances over the entire aircraft flight envelope covering all phases of flight and aircraft at different configurations.\n\nWhile elaboration of mathematical models for BADA 3 was limited by the low availability of high quality reference data, and a requirement to keep the model algorithms simple due to limited computing capabilities, the development of BADA 4 took advantage of today's availability and high quality of aircraft performance reference data and significantly improved computing capabilities.", "metadata": {"source_path": "data/raw/overview-bada-apm.pdf", "doc_type": "pdf", "title": "overview-bada-apm", "page_count": 17, "topic": "## 4.

{"text": "## 6. APPLICATION OF BADA\n\nThe information provided in BADA is designed for use in aircraft trajectory simulation and prediction. As such, BADA is a fundamental enabler for:\n\n- · trajectory simulation in the air traffic modelling and simulation tools\n- · trajectory prediction in the ground-based operational ATM systems.\n\nAir traffic modelling and simulation tools are used to support development, validation and assessment of new ATM concepts, ATC procedures, advanced controller decision support tools and equipment before they are introduced into operational service. These tools can be grouped into three broad categories: mathematical models, fast time and real-time simulation platforms. They are used to obtain performance measurements (safety, capacity, efficiency, environmental impact) and human acceptability of the system under investigation.\n\nOne representative example of real-time simulation tools is the EUROCONTROL Simulation Capability and Platform for Experimentation (ESCAPE). ESCAPE is a large-scale ATM simulation system which provides a platform for real-time human in the loop simulations and trials. It is unique in a sense that it is based on components from ATM industry. The ESCAPE platform is intensively used for airspace validation simulations performed not only at the EUROCONTROL but also at other European research institutions (i.e. ENAV, AENA). ESCAPE is used for ab initio training by the EUROCONTROL Upper Area Centre in Maastricht (MUAC), the EUROCONTROL Institute for Air Navigation Services in Luxembourg (IANS) and the Portuguese Air Force.\n\nAn example of modelling tools that uses BADA is AEM (Advanced Emission Model). The AEM is used to estimate aviation emissions and aircraft fuel burn. It can be used to study emissions around airports as well as estimation of global emissions taking into account large geographical coverage and large size of air traffic.\n\nTrajectory prediction tools used within the ground-based Flight Data Processing Systems provide means for modelling and strategic planning of traffic flows; a better planning of aircraft flows can reduce delays, operating costs and minimizing adverse environmental impact.", "metadata": {"source_path": "data/raw/overview-bada-apm.pdf", "doc_type": "pdf", "title": "overview-bada-apm", "page_count": 17, "topic": "## 6.

CLOSING REMARKS\n\nThis paper gives an overview of the BADA model by providing details on the existing BADA family 3 and insight into the latest achievements in the development of the BADA family 4 model. The BADA model is used worldwide and has become a de facto standard for aircraft performance modelling.\n\nThe current version of BADA family 3 (3.7) provides 103 aircraft type models developed from original aircraft data and referred to as original models. Another 191 aircraft types may be simulated by using an equivalent to an original BADA model. BADA model family 3 has demonstrated its ability to accurately model aircraft performances for aircraft normal operating conditions.\n\nResearch work in aircraft performance modelling demonstrated that enhancements of the BADA aircraft performance model are possible by exploiting today's aircraft performance resources, data and software that were not available in the past, when the BADA was initially developed.\n\nThis resulted in the development of the BADA 4 model, whose enhanced models for drag, thrust and fuel ensure significant improvements in modelling of the vertical speed and fuel flow over the entire aircraft flight envelope. The more realistic and accurate modelling of forces and fuel will enable the computation of new flight regimes such as climb at maximum climb capability or minimum fuel, that are untreatable with the current BADA 3 model.\n\nEUROCONTROL shall continue to maintain the BADA 3 in the future with objective to continuously improve in terms of number and quality of aircraft models. BADA 4 developments will go on in parallel. Preliminary implementation activities for the BADA 4 aircraft models are currently undertaken. The results of this work will serve as an input in the preparation for BADA 4 deployment with the deployment strategy to be defined by the end of 2010.", "metadata": {"source_path": "data/raw/overview-bada-apm.pdf", "doc_type": "pdf", "title": "overview-bada-apm", "page_count": 17, "topic": "general", "chunk_tokens": 411}, "token_count": 411}
